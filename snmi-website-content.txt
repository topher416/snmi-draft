### How Our Research Connects
- How Our Research Connects
- Our two-volume approach first establishes the urgent nature of the crisis, then provides a detailed blueprint for transformation. Together, these papers offer both the "why" and the "how" of safety net modernization in Chicago.

### Advisory Group Perspectives
- Advisory Group Perspectives
- "These papers represent a watershed moment for healthcare in Chicago. They not only diagnose the problem with unprecedented clarity but offer a viable path forward that respects the needs of all stakeholders." â€” Healthcare Executive
- "What makes this initiative different is its comprehensive approach. Rather than addressing symptoms, it tackles root causes and brings together voices that have historically been siloed." â€” Community Health Advocate
- "The financial analysis in Volume One is sobering, but the innovation framework in Volume Two gives me hope. This is the roadmap Chicago has been waiting for." â€” Policy Expert

- Through PhotoVoice, community members share their experiences with Chicago's healthcare system

### PhotoVoice Gallery
- Maria, Pilsen
- "The closed clinic where I used to get my diabetes medication."
- "I've lived in Pilsen for 30 years. When this clinic closed last year, I had to travel an hour by bus to get my medication. Many of my neighbors simply stopped getting care."

- James, Englewood
- "My daughter's asthma medication costs three times what it did last year."
- "Without our local safety net hospital, we're forced to use emergency rooms for basic care. The costs are overwhelming for our family."

- Darnell, Austin
- "The community garden we started after our health center closed."
- "When we lost access to nutritional counseling, our community came together to grow our own food and support each other. It helps, but it's not enough."

- Lucia, Little Village
- "My grandmother waiting for the bus to her new doctor."
- "She's 82 and now has to travel 90 minutes each way for her appointments. The strain of this journey often means she cancels necessary check-ups."

- Robert, Bronzeville
- "The empty building that used to be our mental health clinic."
- "Since this clinic closed, I've watched friends struggle without access to the counseling and medication they need. Our community feels abandoned."

- Aisha, South Shore
- "My son's inhaler that we ration because we can't afford refills."
- "Without insurance coverage, we have to make impossible choices between medication and other necessities. No parent should have to decide if their child can breathe."

- Carlos, Humboldt Park
- "The community health fair we organized to fill the gap."
- "We bring together volunteer doctors and nurses once a month, but it's a band-aid on a gaping wound. Our community needs consistent, accessible healthcare."

- Tanisha, North Lawndale
- "My prescription that I can no longer afford to fill."
- "I've been cutting my blood pressure pills in half to make them last longer. I know it's dangerous, but I don't have a choice after losing my local pharmacy."

## ABOUT PAGE

### Header
- About the Initiative
- A collaborative effort to redesign Chicago's healthcare safety net

### Our Mission
- Our Mission
- The Safety Net Modernization Initiative (SNMI) is a collaborative redesign effort led by providers, funders, and strategists committed to transforming Chicago's healthcare landscape. We bring together diverse stakeholders to address the imminent crisis facing our safety net hospitals and clinics, with a focus on creating sustainable, equitable solutions.
- Our work is guided by a deep commitment to the communities most affected by healthcare disparities. Through rigorous research, community engagement, and strategic planning, we aim to develop and implement a comprehensive redesign of Chicago's safety net that ensures quality care for all residents, regardless of income or zip code.
- The initiative operates as a neutral convener, bringing together voices that have historically been siloed. By fostering collaboration across sectors, we're working to build consensus around bold, transformative solutions to our city's most pressing healthcare challenges.

### What We Believe
- What We Believe
- Equity First: Healthcare access and outcomes should not be determined by race, income, or zip code.
- Community Voice: Those most affected by healthcare disparities must have a central role in designing solutions.
- System Thinking: Sustainable solutions require addressing root causes, not just symptoms of the crisis.
- Collaborative Action: Breaking down silos between stakeholders is essential for meaningful change.
- Data-Driven Decisions: Rigorous analysis and evidence should guide our strategies and implementation.
- Bold Innovation: Transformative change requires reimagining healthcare delivery and financing models.
